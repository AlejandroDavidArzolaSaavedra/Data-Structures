This assignment focused on developing a container in Java using a binary search tree.

## Objectives 🎯

Developed the following operations:

1. Default constructor to create empty containers.
2. "cardinal" function to get the number of elements in the container.
3. "insert" function to add elements to the container.
4. "extract" function to remove elements from the container.
5. "search" function to check the existence of an element in the container.
6. "empty" procedure to leave the container without elements.
7. "elements" function to get an array of integers ordered from lowest to highest.

## Implementation 🛠️

Implemented the container using a binary search tree in dynamic memory without rebalancing operations.

## Testing Instructions 🧪

1. Developed the `TestContainer` class with a main program that checked the correct functioning of all operations of `IntegerContainer`, without using JUnit.

2. Performed performance tests using the files `data.dat` and `data_no.dat`:
   - Insertions and extractions of elements.
   - Successful and unsuccessful searches.
