This assignment aims to develop a linear container in Java using a linked list in dynamic memory. The container, represented by the class "IntegerContainer" in the "assignment1" package, does not require sorting and does not allow repeated elements.


## Objectives ðŸŽ¯

1. Create the following operations:
   - Default constructor to create empty containers.
   - "cardinal" function to get the number of elements in the container.
   - "insert" function to add elements to the container.
   - "extract" function to remove elements from the container.
   - "search" function to check the existence of an element in the container.
   - "empty" procedure to leave the container without elements.
   - "elements" function to get an array of integers with the elements of the container.

2. Implement the internal structure of the container using a linked list in dynamic memory.

## Required Files ðŸ“„

- IntegerContainer.java
- TestContainer.java
- output1.txt (download from the provided link)

## Testing Instructions ðŸ§ª

1. Develop the `TestContainer` class with a main program that checks the correct functioning of all operations of `IntegerContainer`, without using JUnit.

2. Perform performance tests using the files `data.dat` and `data_no.dat`:
   - Insertions and extractions of elements.
   - Successful and unsuccessful searches.
