This project provides an overview of four programming assignments related to structured data and programming. The assignments focus on developing container classes in Java using different data structures, including linked lists, binary search trees, and B-trees. Each assignment has specific objectives, implementation requirements, and testing instructions.

## Assignment 1: Linked List Container 📝

**Objective:** Develop a container class, `LinkedListContainer`, to represent a collection of integers using a singly linked list.

**Implementation:** Create a class with operations like insertion, extraction, searching, and more, using a linked list structure.

**Testing:** Perform tests to ensure the correct functioning of the container without using JUnit.

## Assignment 2: Binary Search Tree Container 📚

**Objective:** Develop a container class, `BinarySearchTreeContainer`, to represent a collection of integers using a binary search tree.

**Implementation:** Create a class with operations such as insertion, extraction, searching, and more, using a binary search tree structure.

**Testing:** Develop a test class, `TestBinarySearchTreeContainer`, to check the correct functioning of the container without using JUnit. Conduct performance tests with specific requirements.

## Assignment 3: Binary Search Tree Container (Advanced)🔄

**Objective:** Extend the binary search tree container developed in Assignment 2. Focus on optimizing performance and conducting detailed performance tests.

**Implementation:** Implement a binary search tree using a dynamic memory structure. Perform various operations and measure the time complexity.

**Testing:** Develop a test class, `PruebaContenedor`, to evaluate the container's performance and behavior under different scenarios. Perform detailed experiments and record results in an output file.

## Assignment 4: B-Tree Container 🌳

**Objective:** Develop a container class, `IntegerContainer`, to represent a collection of integers using a B-tree.

**Implementation:** Implement a B-tree with specified orders. Utilize provided helper classes for file manipulation and conversion. Conduct performance tests with various orders and sizes.

**Testing:** Develop a test class, `TestContainer`, to ensure the correct functioning of the container. Perform performance tests using specific files and orders.

These assignments progressively build on each other, covering fundamental data structures like linked lists and binary search trees, and advancing to more complex structures such as B-trees. Through the assignments, students will gain hands-on experience in designing, implementing, and evaluating the performance of container classes for structured data.
